# Handwritten_Digit_Recognition_CNN
Using MNIST dataset of images to create an Convolutional Neural Network to identify Handwritten Digits

Usage: mabouc4699_Write_Data_to_Folders

       mabouc4699_Project_Three

On execution of mabouc4699_Write_Data_to_Folders, the MNIST training and testing data sets and labels are loaded into folders defined by the MNIST image labels (Example: an image with label 0 would be written to a folder defined by 0). After the function writes the data to the user_defined_paths and directories, the main program will begin via establishing the testing and training paths for use in creating imageDataStores. The layers, options, and number of classes (10 = 0 - 9 possible outcomes) are then defined for the CNN which are subsequently used for training the NN. The accuracy of the CNN is tested through various calculations which the user can explore on execution.
